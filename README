DESCRIPTION
    MooseX::DeclareX takes the declarative sugar of MooseX::Declare to the
    next level. Some people already consider MooseX::Declare to be pretty
    insane. If you're one of those people, then you're not going to like
    this...

  Keywords
    "class", "role", "extends", "with", "is dirty", "is mutable", "clean".
        Inherited from MooseX::Declare.

    "method", "around", "before", "after", "override", "augment"
        Inherited from MooseX::Method::Signatures.

    "try", "catch"
        Inherited from TryCatch.

    "exception"
        "exception Foo" is sugar for "class Foo extends Throwable::Error".
        That is, it creates a class which is a subclass of Throwable::Error.

    "build"
        This is some sugar for creating builder methods. The following two
        examples are roughly equivalent:

                build fullname {
                        join q( ), $self->firstname, $self->surname;
                }

                sub _build_fullname {
                        my $self = shift;
                        join q( ), $self->firstname, $self->surname;
                }

        However, "build" also performs a little housekeeping for you. If an
        attribute does not exist with the same name as the builder, it will
        create one for you (which will be read-only, with type constraint
        "Any" unless "build" can detect a more specific type constraint from
        the method's return signature). If the attribute already exists but
        does not have a builder set, then it will set it.

    "guard"
        Simplifies a common usage pattern for "around". A guard protects a
        method, preventing it from being called unless a condition evaluates
        to true.

                class Doorway
                {
                        method enter ($person)
                        {
                                ...
                        }
                }
        
                class Doorway::Protected
                {
                        has password => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str');
                
                        guard enter ($person)
                        {
                                $person->knows( $self->password )
                        }
                }

    "preprocess"
        Another simplification for a common usage pattern for "around". Acts
        much like "before", but can modify the parameters seen by the base
        method. In fact, it must return the processed parameters as a list.

                class Speaker
                {
                        method speak (@words) {
                                say for @words;
                        }
                }
        
                class Speaker::Loud
                {
                        preprocess speak {
                                return map { uc($_) } @_
                        }
                }

    "postprocess"
        Like "preprocess" but instead acts on the method's return value.

    "read_only", "read_write", "true", "false"
        Useful constants when defining Moose attributes. These are enabled
        by the std_constants plugin.

  Export
    You should indicate which features you are using:

            use MooseX::DeclareX
                    keywords => [qw(class role exception)],
                    plugins  => [qw(guard build)];

    What is the distinction between keywords and plugins? Keywords are the
    words that declare class-like things. Plugins are the other bits, and
    only work inside the class-like declarations.

    Things inherited from MooseX::Declare and MooseX::Method::Signatures do
    not need to be indicated; they are always loaded. Things inherited from
    TryCatch do not need to be indicated; they are available outside class
    declarations too.

    If you don't specify a list of keywords, then the default list is:

            [qw(class role exception)]

    If you don't specify a list of plugins, then the default list is:

            [qw(build guard std_constants)]

    That is, there are certain pieces of functionality which are not
    available by default - they need to be loaded explicitly!

  MooseX::Types
    You can inject a bunch of MooseX::Types keywords into all classes quite
    easily:

      use MooseX::DeclareX
        keywords => [qw(class role exception)],
        plugins  => [qw(build std_constants)],
        types    => [
          -Moose,                 # use MooseX::Types::Moose -all
          -URI => [qw(FileUri)],  # use MooseX::Types::URI qw(FileUri)
                    'Foo::Types',           # use Foo::Types -all
        ];

    As per the example, any module which does not include an arrayref of
    import parameters, gets "-all". A leading hyphen is interpreted as an
    abbreviation for "MooseX::Types::".
